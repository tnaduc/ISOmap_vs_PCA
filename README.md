# ISOmap_vs_PCA
This experiment is to replicate a result from this [paper](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/sci_reprint.pdf). There are lots of details as well as examples in the paper. For my education, I just wanted to redo one of the examples to understand how Isomap works and how it differentiates from another popular dimention-reduction technique, PCA.

Note: Majority of code for visualization is adapted from an exericise in Microsoft data science course DAT210x.
